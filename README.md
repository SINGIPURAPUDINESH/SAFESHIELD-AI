# 🛡️ SafeShield AI

### AI-Powered Digital Safety & Phishing Risk Analyzer

> **HackNowa Global Hackathon 2026**
> **Problem Statement:** Digital Safety & Cybersecurity

SafeShield AI is a defensive cybersecurity application that uses **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, URL analysis, and explainable risk scoring** to help users identify potentially suspicious messages and phishing-style links.

The system analyzes message content and URL characteristics without opening or interacting with submitted URLs. It combines multiple security signals into an easy-to-understand **0–100 risk score**, explains the detected indicators, and provides practical safety recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Digital communication has made phishing, scam messages, fraudulent notifications, and malicious links increasingly difficult for ordinary users to identify.

Many suspicious messages use:

* Urgent language
* Fake account warnings
* Reward or prize claims
* Requests for passwords or OTPs
* Suspicious login pages
* URL shorteners
* IP-address-based links
* Misleading domains
* Unusual URL structures

Users need a simple way to understand **why a message may be risky**, rather than relying only on a binary "safe/unsafe" decision.

---

## 💡 Solution

SafeShield AI provides a lightweight, explainable cybersecurity analysis system.

The application:

1. Accepts a suspicious message from the user.
2. Extracts URLs from the message.
3. Uses an NLP machine-learning model to analyze message language.
4. Performs lexical and structural analysis of detected URLs.
5. Detects common social-engineering indicators.
6. Combines the signals into a 0–100 risk score.
7. Classifies the result as:

   * 🟢 LOW RISK
   * 🟠 SUSPICIOUS
   * 🔴 HIGH RISK
8. Explains the detected risk indicators.
9. Provides recommended safety actions.

# 🚀 Key Features

## 🤖 AI-Based Message Detection

SafeShield AI uses:

* TF-IDF
* Logistic Regression
* NLP text classification

to estimate whether a message contains suspicious language patterns.

---

## 🔗 Safe URL Analysis

URLs are analyzed without visiting them.

The analyzer checks characteristics such as:

* HTTPS vs HTTP
* IP-address domains
* URL length
* Number of subdomains
* Suspicious keywords
* URL shorteners
* Unusual ports
* Encoded characters
* Suspicious file extensions
* Hostname patterns
* Suspicious TLD heuristics

### Security design

SafeShield AI does **not** make network requests to submitted URLs.

This prevents the analysis process from intentionally visiting potentially dangerous destinations.

---

## 🧠 Explainable Risk Scoring

Instead of returning only a classification, SafeShield AI explains the detected indicators.

Example:

```text
Risk Score: 82/100
Risk Level: HIGH RISK

Indicators:
• Urgent language detected
• Sensitive information request detected
• URL uses HTTP
• URL uses an IP address
• Suspicious login keyword detected
```

This makes the system easier for non-technical users to understand.

---

## 🛡️ Safety Recommendations

The system provides actionable recommendations based on the detected indicators.

Examples:

* Avoid opening suspicious links.
* Verify the sender independently.
* Do not share passwords or OTPs.
* Do not provide banking information through unsolicited messages.
* Verify important requests through official channels.

---

## 📊 Risk Classification

| Risk Score | Classification | Meaning                                  |
| ---------: | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|       0–29 | 🟢 LOW RISK    | No strong risk indicators detected       |
|      30–59 | 🟠 SUSPICIOUS  | Several indicators require caution       |
|     60–100 | 🔴 HIGH RISK   | Multiple strong risk indicators detected |

The score is an analytical risk indicator and should not be interpreted as definitive proof that a message is malicious.

# 🧠 AI & Technical Implementation

## 1. Text Classification

The message detector uses a scikit-learn pipeline:

```text
Raw Message
     ↓
TF-IDF Vectorization
     ↓
Logistic Regression
     ↓
Legitimate / Suspicious
```

### TF-IDF

TF-IDF converts text into numerical features based on word and n-gram importance.

The implementation supports:

* Unigrams
* Bigrams
* English stop-word filtering
* Sublinear TF scaling
* Feature limits

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression estimates the probability that a message belongs to the suspicious class.

The resulting probability becomes one of the inputs to the SafeShield risk engine.

---

# 🔍 URL Security Analysis

SafeShield performs **static lexical analysis** of URLs.

For example:

```text
http://192.168.1.50/login
```

may produce indicators such as:

```text
HTTP instead of HTTPS
IP-address hostname
Suspicious login keyword
```

The system does not attempt to connect to:

```text
192.168.1.50
```

or any other submitted destination.

---

# ⚙️ Risk Engine

The risk engine combines multiple independent signals.

Conceptually:

```text
                    NLP Risk
                       │
                       ▼
                  ┌─────────┐
                  │         │
URL Risk ────────►│  Risk   │◄──── Security Heuristics
                  │ Engine  │
                  │         │
                  └────┬────┘
                       │
                       ▼
                Final Risk Score
                    0 – 100
```

The current implementation considers:

* NLP suspicious probability
* URL risk
* Urgency indicators
* Sensitive-information requests
* Multiple URLs
* High-risk URL characteristics

The final score is then mapped to a human-readable risk category.

```

### 7. Explain the safety design

Emphasize:

> SafeShield analyzes URL strings without opening the URLs.

---

# 🔐 Responsible Cybersecurity Design

SafeShield AI is intentionally designed as a **defensive cybersecurity tool**.

It does not:

* Open suspicious URLs
* Execute downloaded files
* Exploit websites
* Attempt unauthorized access
* Collect passwords
* Collect OTPs
* Collect payment credentials
* Perform credential harvesting
* Scan external systems
* Attack infrastructure

The application is intended for **education, awareness, and defensive risk assessment**.

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

SafeShield AI is a risk-assessment prototype and has several limitations.

### 1. Synthetic training data

The initial NLP model uses a small synthetic dataset designed for demonstration and reproducibility.

A production system would require a much larger, diverse, and carefully validated dataset.

### 2. False positives

A legitimate message may contain words such as:

```text
verify
account
payment
security
urgent
```

and therefore receive elevated risk indicators.

### 3. False negatives

Sophisticated phishing messages may avoid obvious suspicious language and therefore evade simple lexical or ML detection.

### 4. URL heuristics

URL structure alone cannot prove that a website is malicious.

A legitimate site can have unusual URL characteristics, while a malicious site can appear technically normal.

### 5. No live threat intelligence

The current system does not query external threat-intelligence databases or reputation services.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Potential future versions could include:

* Larger real-world cybersecurity datasets
* Transformer-based NLP models
* BERT-style message classification
* Domain reputation APIs
* Threat-intelligence integration
* WHOIS/domain-age analysis
* Homograph/IDN detection
* Brand impersonation detection
* QR-code URL analysis
* Email header analysis
* Browser extension integration
* Multilingual phishing detection
* Mobile application
* Continuous model evaluation
* Human-in-the-loop feedback
* Explainable AI dashboards
* Federated/privacy-preserving learning
